        <p>Watercolour is a unique medium that requires diluting paint with water to create a translucent and fluid look on paper.</p>
        <p>Watercolour portraits can be done in a range of styles, ranging from loose and expressive to meticulous and realistic. The technique is gradually layering up layers of paint, beginning with a faint wash of colour and adding features and depth as you go.</p>
        <p>Watercolour portraiture takes skills and practise, but it can be a highly gratifying and fun process. To obtain the desired appearance, use high-quality watercolour paper and paints, as well as experiment with different brushes and techniques.</p>
